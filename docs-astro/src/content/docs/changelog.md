# Changelog

## [0.4.2] - 2025-11-01

### Breaking Changes
- **Default Format Changed**: PTX format is now the default output format (previously TOON)
- **Format Options Renamed**: `toon` now maps to PTX format for backward compatibility

### Major Features

#### PTX Format v1.0
Introduced PTX (Promptext Context Format) as the new default output format:

- **Hybrid Design**: Combines TOON v1.3 metadata efficiency with readable multiline code blocks
- **Token Efficiency**: 25-30% smaller than JSON while maintaining code readability
- **Debugging-Friendly**: Preserves code formatting, indentation, and line breaks
- **Specification**: Created comprehensive PTX v1.0 specification document
- **Backward Compatible**: `toon` format option maps to PTX for existing scripts

#### TOON-Strict Format
Added full TOON v1.3 specification compliance mode:

- **Maximum Compression**: 30-60% smaller than JSON through aggressive optimization
- **Full Compliance**: Follows official TOON v1.3 specification exactly
- **Escaped Strings**: Uses escaped newlines and quotes for all string content
- **Best For**: Token-limited models and metadata-heavy projects
- **Access**: Use `-f toon-strict` or `-f toon-v1.3`

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Relevance Filtering**: The `-r` flag now properly excludes files with score=0 when keywords are provided
- **Fixed Format Detection**: Improved file extension-based format auto-detection

### Documentation
- Created PTX Format Specification v1.0
- Updated all examples to use PTX format
- Added format selection guidelines
- Clarified differences between PTX and TOON-strict modes

### Implementation
- Renamed internal `TOONFormatter` to `PTXFormatter`
- Implemented new `TOONStrictFormatter` for TOON v1.3 compliance
- Added proper string escaping for TOON-strict mode
- Updated CLI to support new format options

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-29

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Token Counting Accuracy**: Resolved critical bug where token counter initialization failure returned 0 tokens for all files
- **Fixed Token Budget Display**: Corrected display showing wrong token counts when using `--max-tokens` (was showing pre-filter totals instead of actual included tokens)

### Major Features

#### Multi-Layered Lock File Detection System
Implemented sophisticated 3-layer detection system for automatic lock file exclusion:

- **Layer 1 - Signature-Based Detection (99% confidence)**
  - Pattern matching for 15+ lock file formats across all major ecosystems
  - Supported formats: `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lockb`, `composer.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`, `packages.lock.json`, and more
  - Requires multiple signature matches to reduce false positives

- **Layer 2 - Ecosystem-Aware Detection (95% confidence)**
  - Automatically detects package managers by scanning for manifest files
  - Context-aware exclusion based on detected ecosystems (Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Go, .NET, Java)
  - Prevents lock file inclusion even for uncommon formats

- **Layer 3 - Generated File Detection (85% confidence)**
  - Heuristic detection of auto-generated files via markers like "@generated", "autogenerated", "do not edit"
  - Low-entropy pattern analysis for repetitive structures
  - Catches minified files, bundles, source maps, and other build artifacts

**Impact**: Automatically excludes massive lock files saving 20-40% tokens on real-world projects (50K-100K+ tokens per file)

### Token Counting System Improvements
- **Fallback Mode**: Added sophisticated approximation when tiktoken is unavailable
  - Word-based + character-based hybrid estimation
  - Code vs prose detection (~3.5 chars/token for code, ~4 for prose)
  - Graceful degradation with user notification
- **Debug Mode**: Added detailed token breakdowns with `DebugTokenCount()` for troubleshooting
- **Comprehensive Tests**: New test suite validating accuracy across different content types

### Performance Optimizations
- **Relevance Scoring**: Eliminated redundant `strings.ToLower()` calls (3x reduction in lowercase operations)
- **String Normalization**: Pre-normalize all strings once instead of per-keyword iteration
- **Config Merging**: Added deduplication for merged exclude patterns

### Code Quality
- Updated all tests to pass with new detection rules
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases
- Improved debug logging throughout the system

### Breaking Changes
- None - maintains full backward compatibility

### Token Savings Examples
| Project Type | Lock Files Excluded | Token Reduction |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Node.js (React) | package-lock.json (500KB) | ~80,000 tokens |
| Python (Poetry) | poetry.lock (200KB) | ~60,000 tokens |
| Rust | Cargo.lock (150KB) | ~45,000 tokens |
| PHP (Laravel) | composer.lock (400KB) | ~70,000 tokens |
